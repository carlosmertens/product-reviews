# PRODUCT REVIEWS

Product Reviews is a repo created to showcase the power of Object-oriented programming.

## Principles demostrated

1. Abstraction

- Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes
- Ignore/hide details or implementations that don't matter to interact

2. Encapsulation

- Reduce complexity + increase reusability
- Keeping some implementation separated and isolated

3. Inheritance

- Eliminate redundant code
- Allow to reuse common logic, methods or properties

4. Polymorphism

- Refactor code that is inherited.
- Instances can improve the logic inherited from a class

## Techniques applied

- Constructor functions
- Factory functions
- ES6 Classes
- Recursice functions and methods
- Prototypes methods
- External library

## Initializing it

The steps taken to initialize the project

1. Create the folder product_reviews with the main files:

- [index.html](/index.html)
- i[ndex.js](/index.js)
- [README.md](/README.md)

2. Initialize "git repository" with "git init" command.

3. Create [package.json](/package.json) file with "npm init" command.

4. Install "readline-sync" dependency with "npm i readline-sync" command.

5. Create [.gitignore](/.gitignore) file and add "node_modules/" to be ignore on the commits.

6. Commit initial installations and files.

7. Create [GitHub repository](https://github.com/carlosmertens/product-reviews) and link it ot the source code.

8. Happy coding...
